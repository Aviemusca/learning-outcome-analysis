# learning-outcome-analysis

A CLI tool for analysing the learning outcomes (LOs) of a curriculum, within a given taxonomy, e.g. Blooms taxonomy.
The tool parses LOs using the spaCy nlp toolkit to identify verbs and gives a breakdown of the taxonomy categories reached by each LO, in json form.
Use a Blooms-based provided taxonomy to analyse your curricula or create your own custom ones.
